####Questions@: ,Lecture 1 Questions
- Derive how to incrementally update a running average (how to compute
  an average of $N$ numbers using the average of the first $N-1$ numbers). [5]

- Describe multi-arm bandits and write down the $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm
  for solving it. [5]

- Define a Markov Decision Process, including the definition of a return. [5]

- Describe how does a partially observable Markov decision process extend the
  Markov decision process and how is the agent altered. [5]

####Questions@: ,Lecture 2 Questions
- Define a value function, such that all expectations are over simple random
  variables (actions, states, rewards), not trajectories. [5]

- Define an action-value function, such that all expectations are over simple
  random variables (actions, states, rewards), not trajectories. [5]

  action-value function using a value function. [5]
