### Assignment: car_racing
#### Date: Deadline: Dec 2, 23:59
#### Points: **10** bonus only

In this bonus-only exercise to play with Deep Q Network and its variants,
try solving the [CarRacing-v0 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CarRacing-v0)
environment from the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).

The evaluator module will be provided shortly. The states are RGB images of size
$96×96×3$, but you can downsample them even more (reasonable performance can
be achieved even with $16×16×3$.

Note that ReCodEx cannot generate the images, so the evaluation will be
performed manually after the deadline (but still submit your solutions to
ReCodEx).

The task is again a _competition_ and at most 7 points will be awarded
according to relative ordering of your solution performances.
