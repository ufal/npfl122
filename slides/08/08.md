# REINFORCE Algorithm

The REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) uses directly the policy gradient
theorem, maximizing $J(→θ) ≝ 𝔼_{h, π} v_π(s)$. To compute the gradient
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} q_π(s, a) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ),$$
REINFORCE algorithm estimates the $q_π(s, a)$ by a single sample.

# REINFORCE with Baseline

The returns can be arbitrary – better-than-average and worse-than-average
returns cannot be recognized from the absolute value of the return.

Hopefully, we can generalize the policy gradient theorem using a baseline $b(s)$
to
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} \big(q_π(s, a) - b(s)\big) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ).$$

A good choice for $b(s)$ is $v_π(s)$, which can be shown to minimize variance of
the estimator. Such baseline reminds centering of returns, given that
$v_π(s) = 𝔼_{a ∼ π} q_π(s, a)$. Then, better-than-average returns are positive
and worse-than-average returns are negative.

The resulting value is also called an _advantage function_
$a_π(s, a) ≝ q_π(s, a) - v_π(s)$.

Of course, the $v_π(s)$ baseline can be only approximated. If neural networks
are used to estimate $π(a|s; →θ)$, then some part of the network is usually
shared between the policy and value function estimation, which is trained using
mean square error of the predicted and observed return.

# Actor-Critic

It is possible to combine the policy gradient methods and temporal difference
methods, creating a family of algorithms usually called _actor-critic_ methods.

The idea is straightforward – instead of estimating the episode return using the
whole episode rewards, we can use $n$-step temporal difference estimation.

# Asynchronous Methods for Deep RL

A 2015 paper from Volodymyr Mnih et al., the same group as DQN.

~~~
The authors propose an asynchronous framework, where multiple workers share one
neural network, each training using either an off-line or on-line RL algorithm.

~~~
They compare 1-step Q-learning, 1-step Sarsa, $n$-step Q-learning and A3C
(an _asynchronous advantage actor-critic_ method). For A3C, they compare
a version with and without LSTM.

~~~
The authors also introduce _entropy regularization term_ $β H(π(s; →θ))$ to the
loss to support exploration and discourage premature convergence.

# Parallel Advantage Actor Critic

An alternative to independent workers is to train in a synchronous and
centralized way by having the workes to only generate episodes. Such approach
was described in May 2017 by Clemente et al., who named their agent
_parallel advantage actor-critic_ (PAAC).

# Parallel Advantage Actor Critic

![w=70%,h=center](paac_performance.pdf)

The authors use $8$ workers, $n_e=32$ parallel environments, $5$-step returns,
$γ=0.99$, $ε=0.1$, $β=0.01$ and a learning rate of $α=0.0007⋅n_e=0.0224$.

The $\textrm{arch}_\textrm{nips}$ is from A3C: 16 filters $8×8$ stride 4, 32
filters $4×4$ stride 2, a dense layer with 256 units. The
$\textrm{arch}_\textrm{nature}$ is from DQN: 32 filters $8×8$ stride 4, 64
filters $4×4$ stride 2, 64 filters $3×3$ stride 1 and 512-unit fully connected
layer. All nonlinearities are ReLU.

section: Continuous Action Space
# Continuous Action Space

Until now, the actions were discrete. However, many environments naturally
accept actions from continuous space. We now consider actions which come
from range $[a, b]$ for $a, b ∈ ℝ$, or more generally from a Cartesian product
of several such ranges:
$$∏_i [a_i, b_i].$$

~~~
![w=40%,f=right](normal_distribution.pdf)
A simple way how to parametrize the action distribution is to choose them from
the normal distribution.

Given mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$, probability density function of $𝓝(μ, σ^2)$
is
$$p(x) ≝ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 π σ^2}} e^{\large-\frac{(x - μ)^2}{2σ^2}}.$$

# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

Utilizing continuous action spaces in gradient-based methods is straightforward.
Instead of the $\softmax$ distribution we suitably parametrize the action value,
usually using the normal distribution. Considering only one real-valued action,
we therefore have
$$π(a | s; →θ) ≝ P\Big(a ∼ 𝓝\big(μ(s; →θ), σ(s; →θ)^2\big)\Big),$$
where $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ are function approximation of mean and standard
deviation of the action distribution.

The mean and standard deviation are usually computed from the shared
representation, with
- the mean being computed as a regular regression (i.e., one output neuron
  without activation);
- the standard variance (which must be positive) being computed again as
  a regression, followed most commonly by either $\exp$ or
  $\operatorname{softplus}$, where $\operatorname{softplus}(x) ≝ \log(1 + e^x)$.

# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

During training, we compute $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ and then sample the action
value (clipping it to $[a, b]$ if required). To compute the loss, we utilize
the probability density function of the normal distribution (and usually also
add the entropy penalty).

~~~
```python
  mu = tf.layers.dense(hidden_layer, 1)[:, 0]
  sd = tf.layers.dense(hidden_layer, 1)[:, 0]
  sd = tf.exp(log_sd)   # or sd = tf.nn.softplus(sd)

  normal_dist = tf.distributions.Normal(mu, sd)

  # Loss computed as - log π(a|s) - entropy_regularization
  loss = - normal_dist.log_prob(self.actions) * self.returns \
         - args.entropy_regularization * normal_dist.entropy()
```

---
# Continuous Action Space

When the action consists of several real values, i.e., action is a suitable
subregion of $ℝ^n$ for $n>1$, we can:
- either use multivariate Gaussian distribution;
- or factorize the probability into a product of univariate normal
  distributions.

~~~
Modeling the action distribution using a single normal distribution might be
insufficient, in which case a mixture of normal distributions is usually used.

~~~
Sometimes, the continuous action space is used even for discrete output -- when
modeling pixels intensities (256 values) or sound amplitude (2$^{16}$ values),
instead of a softmax we use discretized mixture of distributions,
usually $\operatorname{logistic}$ (a distribution with a sigmoid cdf). Then,
$$π(a) = ∑_i p_i\Big(σ\big((a + 0.5 - μ_i) / σ_i\big) - σ\big((a - 0.5 - μ_i) / σ_i\big) \Big).$$
However, such mixtures are usually used in generative modeling, not in
reinforcement learning.
