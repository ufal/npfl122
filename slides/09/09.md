# Off-policy Correction Using Control Variates

Denoting the TD error as $δ_t ≝ R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)$, we can
write the $n$-step estimated return as a sum of TD errors:
$$G_{t:t+n} = V(S_t) + ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i δ_{t+i}.$$

~~~
Furthermore, denoting the importance sampling ratio
$ρ_t ≝ \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)},~~~ρ_{t:t+n} ≝ ∏_{i=0}^n ρ_{t+i},$
~~~
we can introduce the **control variate** to the estimate
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} ≝ ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}\big) + (1 - ρ_t)V(S_t),$$

~~~
which can then be written as
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i}.$$

# Eligibility Traces

Eligibility traces are a mechanism of combining multiple $n$-step return
estimates for various values of $n$.

~~~
First note instead of an $n$-step return, we can use any average of $n$-step
returns for different values of $n$, for example
$\frac{2}{3}G_{t:t+2} + \frac{1}{3}G_{t:t+4}$.

---
# $λ$-return

For a given $λ ∈ [0,1]$, we define **$λ$-return** as
$$G_t^λ ≝ (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^∞ λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i}.$$

~~~
![w=75%,f=right](../08/traces_weighting.svgz)

~~~
Alternatively, the $λ$-return can be written recursively as
$$\begin{aligned}
G_t^λ &= (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1} \\
      &+ λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1}^λ).
\end{aligned}$$

---
# $λ$-return

In an episodic task with time of termination $T$, we can rewrite the $λ$-return
to
$$G_t^λ = (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^{T-t-1} λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i} + λ^{T-t-1} G_t.$$

~~~
![w=60%,h=center](../08/traces_example.svgz)

---
# Truncated $λ$-return

We might also set a limit on the largest value of $n$, obtaining
**truncated $λ$-return**
$$G_{t:t+n}^λ ≝ (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i} + λ^{n-1} G_{t:t+n}.$$

~~~
The truncated $λ$ return can be again written recursively as

$$G_{t:t+n}^λ = (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1} + λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^λ),~~G_{t:t+1}^λ = G_{t:t+1}.$$

~~~
Similarly to before, we can express the truncated $λ$ return as a sum of TD
errors

$$\begin{aligned}
  G_{t:t+n}^λ - V(S_t)
  & = (1 - λ) \big(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1})\big) + λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^λ) - V(S_t) \\
  & = R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) + λ γ \big(G_{t+1:t+n}^λ - V(S_{t+1})\big),
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
obtaining an analogous estimate $G_{t:t+n}^λ = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i λ^i δ_{t+i}.$

---
# Variable $λ$s

The (truncated) $λ$-return can be generalized to utilize different $λ_i$ at each
step $i$. Notably, we can generalize the recursive definition

$$G_{t:t+n}^λ = (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1} + λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^λ)$$

~~~
to
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ_i} = (1 - λ_{t+1}) G_{t:t+1} + λ_{t+1} (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^{λ_i}),$$

~~~
and express this quantity again by a sum of TD errors:

$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ_i} = V(S_t) + ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(∏_{j=1}^i λ_{t+j}\right) δ_{t+i}.$$

---
# Off-policy Traces with Control Variates

Finally, we can combine the eligibility traces with off-policy estimation using
control variates:
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} ≝ (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i}^\mathrm{CV} + λ^{n-1} G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}.$$

~~~
Recalling that
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} = ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}\big) + (1 - ρ_t)V(S_t),$$
~~~

we can rewrite $G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}}$ recursively as
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} = (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1}^\mathrm{CV} + λ \Big(ρ_t\big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}}\big) + (1-ρ_t)V(S_t)\Big),$$

~~~
which we can simplify by expanding $G_{t:t+1}^\mathrm{CV}=ρ_t(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1})) + (1-ρ_t)V(S_t)$ to
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} - V(S_t) = ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\big) + γλρ_t \big(G_{t+1:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} - V(S_{t+1})\big).$$

---
# Off-policy Traces with Control Variates

Consequently, analogously as before, we can write the off-policy traces estimate
with control variates as

$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{λ,CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i λ^i ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i},$$

~~~
and by repeating the above derivation we can extend the result also for time-variable $λ_i$, we obtain
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{λ_i,CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(∏_{j=1}^i λ_{t+j}\right) ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i}.$$

section: Vtrace
# V-trace

V-trace is a modified version of $n$-step return with off-policy correction,
defined in the Feb 2018 IMPALA paper as (using the notation from the paper):

$$G_{t:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace} ≝ V(S_t) + ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_{t+j}\right) ρ̄_{t+i} δ_{t+i},$$

~~~
where $ρ̄_t$ and $c̄_t$ are the truncated importance sampling ratios for $ρ̄ ≥ c̄$:
$$ρ̄_t ≝ \min\left(ρ̄, \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)}\right),~~~~c̄_t ≝ \min\left(c̄, \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)}\right).$$

~~~
Note that if $b=π$ and assuming $c̄ ≥ 1$, $v_s$ reduces to $n$-step Bellman
target.

---
# V-trace

Note that the truncated IS weights $ρ̄_t$ and $c̄_t$ play different roles:

~~~
- The $ρ̄_t$ appears defines the fixed point of the update rule. For $ρ̄=∞$, the
  target is the value function $v_π$, if $ρ̄<∞$, the fixed point is somewhere
  between $v_π$ and $v_b$. Notice that we do not compute a product of these
  $ρ̄_t$ coefficients.

~~~
  Concretely, the fixed point of an operator defined by $G_{t:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace}$
  corresponds to a value function of the policy
  $$π_ρ̄(a|s) ∝ \min\big(ρ̄b(a|s), π(a|s)\big).$$

~~~
- The $c̄_t$ impacts the speed of convergence (the contraction rate of the
  Bellman operator), not the sought policy. Because a product of the $c̄_t$
  ratios is computed, it plays an important role in variance reduction.

~~~
However, the paper utilizes $c̄=1$ and out of $ρ̄ ∈ \{1, 10, 100\}$, $ρ̄=1$ works
empirically the best, so the distinction between $c̄_t$ and $ρ̄_t$ is not useful in
practice.

# V-trace Analysis

Let us define the (untruncated for simplicity; similar results can be proven for
a truncated one) V-trace operator $𝓡$ as:
$$𝓡 V(S_t) ≝ V(S_t) + 𝔼_b \left[∑\nolimits_{i ≥ 0} γ^i \left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_{t+j}\right) ρ̄_{t+i} δ_{t+i}\right],$$
where the expectation $𝔼_b$ is with respect to trajectories generated by behaviour policy $b$.
~~~

Assuming there exists $β ∈ (0, 1]$ such that $𝔼_b ρ̄_0 ≥ β$,
~~~
it can be proven (see Theorem 1 in Appendix A.1 in the Impala paper if interested) that
such an operator is a contraction with a contraction constant
$$γ^{-1} - \big(γ^{-1} - 1\big) \underbrace{∑\nolimits_{i ≥ 0} γ^i 𝔼_b \left[\left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_j\right) ρ̄_i \right]}_{≥ 1 + γ𝔼_b ρ̄_0} ≤ 1-(1-γ)β<1,$$
therefore, $𝓡$ has a unique fixed point.

---
# V-trace Analysis

We now prove that the fixed point of $𝓡$ is $V^{π_ρ̄}$. We have:

$\displaystyle 𝔼_b \big[ρ̄_t δ_t\big] = 𝔼_b \Big[ ρ̄_t\big(R_{t+1} + γ V^{π_ρ̄}(S_{t+1}) - V^{π_ρ̄}(S_t)\big)\big| S_t\Big]$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern1em = ∑\nolimits_a b(a|S_t) \min\left(\bar \rho, \frac{π(a|S_t)}{b(a|S_t)} \right) \Big[R_{t+1} + γ 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(S_t, a)} V^{π_ρ̄}(s') - V^{π_ρ̄}(S_t)\Big]$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern1em = \underbrace{∑\nolimits_a π_ρ̄(a|S_t) \Big[R_{t+1} + γ 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(S_t, a)} V^{π_ρ̄}(s') - V^{π_ρ̄}(S_t)\Big]}_{=0} ∑_{a'} \min\big(ρ̄ b(a'|S_t), π(a'|S_t) \big)$

~~~
$\displaystyle \kern1em = 0,$

where the tagged part is zero, since it is the Bellman equation for $V^{π_ρ̄}$.
~~~
This shows that $𝓡 V^{π_ρ̄}(s) = V^{π_ρ̄}(s) + 𝔼_b \left[∑\nolimits_{i ≥ 0} γ^i \left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_{t+j}\right) ρ̄_{t+i} δ_{t+i}\right]
= V^{π_ρ̄}$, and therefore $V^{π_ρ̄}$ is the unique fixed point of $𝓡$.

~~~
Consequently, in
$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{λ_i,CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(\scriptstyle ∏_{j=1}^i λ_{t+j}\right) ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i},$
only the last $ρ_{t+i}$ from every $ρ_{t:t+i}$ is actually needed for off-policy
correction; $ρ_{t:t+i-1}$ can be considered as traces.

section: IMPALA
# IMPALA

Impala (**Imp**ortance Weighted **A**ctor-**L**earner **A**rchitecture) was
suggested in Feb 2018 paper and allows massively distributed implementation
of an actor-critic-like learning algorithm.

~~~
Compared to A3C-based agents, which communicate gradients with respect to the
parameters of the policy, IMPALA actors communicate trajectories to the
centralized learner.

~~~
![w=50%](impala_overview.svgz)
~~~ ~~
![w=50%](impala_overview.svgz)![w=50%](impala_comparison.svgz)

~~~
If many actors are used, the policy used to generate a trajectory can lag behind
the latest policy. Therefore, the V-trace off-policy actor-critic
algorithm is employed.

---
# IMPALA

Consider a parametrized functions computing $v(s; →θ)$ and $π(a|s; →ω)$,
we update the critic in the direction of
$$\Big(G_{t:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace} - v(S_t; →θ)\Big) ∇_{→θ} v(S_t; →θ),$$

~~~
and the actor in the direction of the policy gradient
$$ρ̄_t ∇_{→ω} \log π(A_t | S_t; →ω)\big(R_{t+1} + γG_{t+1:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace} - v(S_t; →θ)\big).$$

~~~
Finally, we again add the entropy regularization term $β H\big(π(⋅ | S_t; →ω)\big)$ to the
loss function.

# IMPALA – Population Based Training

For Atari experiments, population based training with a population of 24 agents
is used to adapt entropy regularization, learning rate, RMSProp $ε$ and the
global gradient norm clipping threshold.

In population based training, several agents are trained in parallel. When an
agent is _ready_ (after 5000 episodes), then:
~~~
- it may be overwritten by parameters and hyperparameters of another randomly
  chosen agent, if it is sufficiently better (5000 episode mean capped human
  normalized score returns are 5% better);
~~~
- and independently, the hyperparameters may undergo a change (multiplied by
  either 1.2 or 1/1.2 with 33% chance).

  very small and lead to unstabilities during $\log π$
  computation;

  no $c$s; it can be considered V-trace “without traces”.

section: PopArt
# PopArt Normalization

An improvement of IMPALA from Sep 2018, which performs normalization of task
rewards instead of just reward clipping. PopArt stands for _Preserving Outputs
Precisely, while Adaptively Rescaling Targets_.

~~~
Assume the value estimate $v(s; →θ, σ, μ)$ is computed using a normalized value
predictor $n(s; →θ)$
$$v(s; →θ, σ, μ) ≝ σ n(s; →θ) + μ,$$
and further assume that $n(s; →θ)$ is an output of a linear function
$$n(s; →θ) ≝ →ω^T f(s; →θ-\{→ω, b\}) + b.$$

~~~
We can update the $σ$ and $μ$ using exponentially moving average with decay rate
$β$ (in the paper, first moment $μ$ and second moment $υ$ is tracked, and
the standard deviation is computed as $σ=\sqrt{υ-μ^2}$; decay rate $β=3 ⋅ 10^{-4}$ is employed).

---
# PopArt Normalization

Utilizing the parameters $μ$ and $σ$, we can normalize the observed (unnormalized) returns as
$(G - μ) / σ$, and use an actor-critic algorithm with advantage $(G - μ)/σ - n(S; →θ)$.

~~~
However, in order to make sure the value function estimate does not change when
the normalization parameters change, the parameters $→ω, b$ used to compute the
value estimate
$$v(s; →θ, σ, μ) ≝ σ ⋅ \Big(→ω^T f(s; →θ-\{→ω, b\}) + b\Big) + μ$$
are updated under any change $μ → μ'$ and $σ → σ'$ as
$$\begin{aligned}
  →ω' &← \frac{σ}{σ'}→ω,\\
  b' &← \frac{σb + μ - μ'}{σ'}.
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
In multi-task settings, we train a task-agnostic policy and task-specific value
functions (therefore, $→μ$, $→σ$, and $→n(s; →θ)$ are vectors).

# Transformed Rewards

So far, we have clipped the rewards in DQN on Atari environments.

~~~
Consider a Bellman operator $𝓣$
$$(𝓣q)(s, a) ≝ 𝔼_{s',r ∼ p} \Big[r + γ \max_{a'} q(s', a')\Big].$$

~~~
Instead of clipping the magnitude of rewards, we might use a function
$h: ℝ → ℝ$ to reduce their scale. We define a transformed Bellman operator
$𝓣_h$ as
$$(𝓣_hq)(s, a) ≝ 𝔼_{s',r ∼ p} \Big[h\Big(r + γ \max_{a'} h^{-1} \big(q(s', a')\big)\Big)\Big].$$

---
# Transformed Rewards

It is easy to prove the following two propositions from a 2018 paper
_Observe and Look Further: Achieving Consistent Performance on Atari_ by Tobias
Pohlen et al.

~~~
1. If $h(z) = α z$ for $α > 0$, then $𝓣_h^k q \xrightarrow{k → ∞} h \circ q_* = α q_*$.

~~~
   The statement follows from the fact that it is equivalent to scaling the
   rewards by a constant $α$.

~~~
2. When $h$ is strictly monotonically increasing and the MDP is deterministic,
   then $𝓣_h^k q \xrightarrow{k → ∞} h \circ q_*$.

~~~
   This second proposition follows from
   $$h \circ q_* = h \circ 𝓣 q_* = h \circ 𝓣(h^{-1} \circ h \circ q_*) = 𝓣_h(h \circ q_*),$$
   where the last equality only holds if the MDP is deterministic.

---
# Transformed Rewards

For stochastic MDP, the authors prove that if $h$ is strictly monotonically
increasing, Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $L_h$, and has a
Lipschitz continuous inverse with Lipschitz constant $L_{h^{-1}}$, then
for $γ < \frac{1}{L_h L_{h^{-1}}}$, $𝓣_h$ is again a contraction. (Proof
in Proposition A.1.)

~~~
For the Atari environments, the authors propose the transformation
$$h(x) ≝ \sign(x)\left(\sqrt{|x| + 1} - 1\right) + εx$$
with $ε = 10^{-2}$. The additive regularization term ensures that
$h^{-1}$ is Lipschitz continuous.

~~~
It is straightforward to verify that
$$h^{-1}(x) = \sign(x)\left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 + 4ε (|x| + 1 + ε)} - 1}{2ε} \right)^2 - 1\right).$$

~~~
In practice, discount factor larger than $\frac{1}{L_h L_{h^{-1}}}$ is being
used – however, it seems to work.

---
section: R2D2
# Recurrent Replay Distributed DQN (R2D2)

Proposed in 2019, to study the effects of recurrent state, experience replay and
distributed training.

~~~
R2D2 utilizes prioritized replay, $n$-step double Q-learning with $n=5$,
convolutional layers followed by a 512-dimensional LSTM passed to duelling
architecture, generating experience by a large number of actors (256; each
performing approximately 260 steps per second) and learning from batches by
a single learner (achieving 5 updates per second using mini-batches of 64
sequences of length 80).

~~~
Rewards are transformed instead of clipped, and no loss-of-life-as-episode-end
heuristic is used.

~~~
Instead of individual transitions, the replay buffer consists of fixed-length
($m=80$) sequences of $(s, a, r)$, with adjacent sequences overlapping by 40
time steps.

~~~
The prioritized replay employs a combination of the maximum and the average
absolute 5-step TD errors $δ_i$ over the sequence: $p = η \max_i δ_i + (1 - η)
δ̄$, for $η$ and the priority exponent set to 0.9.

# Agent57

The Agent57 is an agent (from Mar 2020) capable of outperforming the standard
human benchmark on all 57 games.

~~~
Its most important components are:
- Retrace; from _Safe and Efficient Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning_ by Munos
  et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02647,
~~~
- Never give up strategy; from _Never Give Up: Learning Directed Exploration Strategies_
  by Badia et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06038,
~~~
- Agent57 itself; from _Agent57: Outperforming the Atari Human Benchmark_ by
  Badia et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13350.

# Retrace

$\displaystyle \mathrlap{𝓡q(s, a) ≝ q(s, a) + 𝔼_b \bigg[∑_{t≥0} γ^t \left(∏\nolimits_{j=1}^t c_t\right)
  \Big(R_{t+1} + γ𝔼_{A_{t+1} ∼ π} q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) - q(S_t, A_t)\Big)\bigg],}$

where there are several possibilities for defining the traces $c_t$:
~~~
- **importance sampling**, $c_t = ρ_t = \frac{π(A_t|S_t)}{b(A_t|S_t)}$,
  - the usual off-policy correction, but with possibly very high variance,
  - note that $c_t = 1$ in the on-policy case;
~~~
- **Tree-backup TB(λ)**, $c_t = λ π(A_t|S_t)$,
  - the Tree-backup algorithm extended with traces,
  - however, $c_t$ can be much smaller than 1 in the on-policy case;
~~~
- **Retrace(λ)**, $c_t = λ \min\big(1, \frac{π(A_t|S_t)}{b(A_t|S_t)}\big)$,
  - off-policy correction with limited variance, with $c_t = 1$ in the on-policy case.

~~~
The authors prove that $𝓡$ has a unique fixed point $q_π$ for any
$0 ≤ c_t ≤ \frac{π(A_t|S_t)}{b(A_t|S_t)}$.

# Never Give Up

The NGU (Never Give Up) agent performs _curiosity-driver exploration_, and
augment the extrinsic (MDP) rewards with an intrinsic reward. The augmented
reward at time $t$ is then $r_t^β ≝ r_t^e + β r_t^i$, with $β$ a scalar
weight of the intrinsic reward.

~~~
The intrinsic reward fulfills three goals:

~~~
1. quickly discourage visits of the same state in the same episode;

~~~
2. slowly discourage visits of the states visited many times in all episodes;

~~~
3. ignore the parts of the state not influenced by the agent's actions.

~~~
The intrinsic rewards is a combination of the episodic novelty $r_t^\textrm{episodic}$
and life-long novelty $α_t$:
$$r_t^i ≝ r_t^\textrm{episodic} ⋅ \operatorname{clip}\Big(1 ≤ α_t ≤ L=5\Big).$$

# Never Give Up

![w=70%,f=right](ngu_novelty.png)

The episodic novelty works by storing the embedded states $f(S_t)$ visited
during the episode in episodic memory $M$.

~~~
The $r_t^\textrm{episodic}$ is then estimated as

$$r_t^\textrm{episodic} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\textrm{visit~count~of~}f(S_t)}}.$$

~~~
The visit count is estimated using similarities of $k$-nearest neighbors of $f(S_t)$
measured via an inverse kernel $K(x, z) = \frac{ε}{\frac{d(x, z)^2}{d_m^2} + ε}$ for
$d_m$ a running mean of the $k$-nearest neighbor distance:

$$r_t^\textrm{episodic} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{∑\nolimits_{f_i ∈ N_k} K(f(S_t), f_i)}+c}\textrm{,~~with~pseudo-count~c=0.001}.$$

# Never Give Up

The state embeddings are trained to ignore the parts not influenced by the actions of the agent.

~~~

To this end, Siamese network $f$ is trained to predict $p(A_t|S_t, S_{t+1})$,
i.e., the action $A_t$ taken by the agent in state $S_t$ when the resulting
state is $S_{t+1}$.

~~~
The life-long novelty $α_t=1 + \tfrac{\|ĝ - g\|^2 - μ_\textrm{err}}{σ_\textrm{err}}$
is trained using random network distillation (RND),
where a predictor network $ĝ$ tries to predict the output of an untrained
convolutional network $g$ by minimizing the mean squared error; the
$μ_\textrm{err}$ and $σ_\textrm{err}$ are the running mean and standard
deviation of the error $\|ĝ-g\|^2$.

# Never Give Up

![w=18%,f=right](ngu_architecture.svgz)

The NGU agent uses transformed Retrace loss with the augmented reward
$$r_t^i ≝ r_t^\textrm{episodic} ⋅ \operatorname{clip}\Big(1 ≤ α_t ≤ L=5\Big).$$

~~~
![w=23%,f=left](ngu_betas_gammas.svgz)

To support multiple policies concentrating either on the extrinsic or the
intrinsic reward, the NGU agent trains a parametrized action-value function $q(s, a, β_i)$
which corresponds to reward $r_t^{β_i}$ for $β_0=0$ and $γ_0=0.997$, …, $β_{N-1}=β$
and $γ_{N-1}=0.99$.

For evaluation, $q(s, a, 0)$ is employed.

Then Agent57 improves NGU with:
~~~
- splitting the action-value as $q(s, a, j; →θ) ≝ q(s, a, j; →θ^e) + β_j q(s, a, j; →θ^i)$, where

  - $q(s, a, j; →θ^e)$ is trained with $r_e$ as targets, and
  - $q(s, a, j; →θ^i)$ is trained with $r_i$ as targets.

~~~
- instead of considering all $(β_j, γ_j)$ equal, we train a meta-controller
  using a non-stationary multi-arm bandit algorithm, where arms correspond
  to the choice of $j$ for a whole episode (so an actor first samples a $j$
  using multi-arm bandit problem and then updates it according to the observed
  return), and the reward signal is the undiscounted extrinsic episode return;
  each actor uses a different level of $ε_l$-greedy behavior;

~~~
- $γ_{N-1}$ is increased from $0.997$ to $0.9999$.
