# REINFORCE with Baseline

The returns can be arbitrary – better-than-average and worse-than-average
returns cannot be recognized from the absolute value of the return.

Hopefully, we can generalize the policy gradient theorem using a baseline $b(s)$
to
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} \big(q_π(s, a) - b(s)\big) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ).$$

A good choice for $b(s)$ is $v_π(s)$, which can be shown to minimize variance of
the estimator. Such baseline reminds centering of returns, given that
$v_π(s) = 𝔼_{a ∼ π} q_π(s, a)$. Then, better-than-average returns are positive
and worse-than-average returns are negative.

The resulting value is also called an _advantage function_
$a_π(s, a) ≝ q_π(s, a) - v_π(s)$.

Of course, the $v_π(s)$ baseline can be only approximated. If neural networks
are used to estimate $π(a|s; →θ)$, then some part of the network is usually
shared between the policy and value function estimation, which is trained using
mean square error of the predicted and observed return.

# Parallel Advantage Actor Critic

An alternative to independent workers is to train in a synchronous and
centralized way by having the workes to only generate episodes. Such approach
was described in May 2017 by Celemente et al., who named their agent
_parallel advantage actor-critic_ (PAAC).

# Continuous Action Space

Until now, the actions were discreet. However, many environments naturally
accept actions from continuous space. We now consider actions which come
from range $[a, b]$ for $a, b ∈ ℝ$, or more generally from a Cartesian product
of several such ranges:
$$∏_i [a_i, b_i].$$

![w=40%,f=right](../08/normal_distribution.pdf)
A simple way how to parametrize the action distribution is to choose them from
the normal distribution.

Given mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$, probability density function of $𝓝(μ, σ^2)$
is
$$p(x) ≝ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 π σ^2}} e^{\large-\frac{(x - μ)^2}{2σ^2}}.$$

---
# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

Utilizing continuous action spaces in gradient-based methods is straightforward.
Instead of the $\softmax$ distribution we suitably parametrize the action value,
usually using the normal distribution. Considering only one real-valued action,
we therefore have
$$π(a | s; →θ) ≝ P\Big(a ∼ 𝓝\big(μ(s; →θ), σ(s; →θ)^2\big)\Big),$$
where $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ are function approximation of mean and standard
deviation of the action distribution.

The mean and standard deviation are usually computed from the shared
representation, with
- the mean being computed as a regular regression (i.e., one output neuron
  without activation);
- the standard variance (which must be positive) being computed again as
  a regression, followed most commonly by either $\exp$ or
  $\operatorname{softplus}$, where $\operatorname{softplus}(x) ≝ \log(1 + e^x)$.

# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

During training, we compute $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ and then sample the action
value (clipping it to $[a, b]$ if required). To compute the loss, we utilize
the probability density function of the normal distribution (and usually also
add the entropy penalty).

```python
  mu = tf.layers.dense(hidden_layer, 1)[:, 0]
  sd = tf.layers.dense(hidden_layer, 1)[:, 0]
  sd = tf.exp(log_sd)   # or sd = tf.nn.softplus(sd)

  normal_dist = tf.distributions.Normal(mu, sd)

  # Loss computed as - log π(a|s) - entropy_regularization
  loss = - normal_dist.log_prob(self.actions) * self.returns \
         - args.entropy_regularization * normal_dist.entropy()
```

# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem

Combining continuous actions and Deep Q Networks is not straightforward.
In order to do so, we need a different variant of the policy gradient theorem.

~~~
Recall that in policy gradient theorem,
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} q_π(s, a) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ).$$

~~~
## Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem
Assume that the policy $π(s; →θ)$ is deterministic and computes
an action $a∈ℝ$. Then under several assumptions about continuousness, the
following holds:
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ 𝔼_{s∼μ(s)} \Big[∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s;→θ)}\Big].$$

The theorem was first proven in the paper Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms
by David Silver et al.

---
# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem – Proof

The proof is very similar to the original (stochastic) policy gradient theorem.
We assume that $p(s' | s, a), ∇_a p(s' | s, a), r(s, a), ∇_a r(s, a), π(s; →θ), ∇_→θ π(s; →θ)$
are continuous in all params.

~~~
$\displaystyle ∇_→θ v_π(s) = ∇_→θ q_π(s, π(s; →θ))$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ\Big(r\big(s, π(s; →θ)\big) + γ ∫_{s'} p\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) v_π(s') \d s'\Big)$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a r(s, a) \big|_{a=π(s; →θ)} + γ ∇_→θ ∫_{s'} p\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) v_π(s') \d s'$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a \Big( r(s, a) \big|_{a=π(s; →θ)} + γ ∫_{s'} p\big(s' | s, a)\big) v_π(s') \d s' \Big) \\
                    \qquad\qquad\qquad + γ ∫_{s'} p\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) ∇_→θ v_π(s') \d s'$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s; →θ)} + γ ∫_{s'} p\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) ∇_→θ v_π(s') \d s'$

~~~
Similarly to the gradient theorem, we finish the proof by continually expanding $∇_→θ v_π(s')$.

# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

Note that the formulation of deterministic policy gradient theorem allows an
off-policy algorithm, because the loss functions no longer depends on actions
(similarly to how expected Sarsa is also an off-policy algorithm).

~~~
We therefore train function approximation for both $π(s; →θ)$ and $q(s, a; →θ)$,
training $q(s, a; →θ)$ using a deterministic variant of the Bellman equation:
$$q(S_t, A_t; →θ) = 𝔼_{R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}} \big[R_{t+1} + γ q(S_{t+1}, π(S_{t+1}; →θ))\big]$$
and $π(s; →θ)$ according to the deterministic policy gradient theorem.

~~~
The algorithm was first described in the paper Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning
by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al. (2015).

The authors utilize a replay buffer, a target network (updated by exponential
moving average with $τ=0.001$), batch normalization for CNNs, and perform
exploration by adding a normal-distributed noise to predicted actions.
Training is performed by Adam with learning rates of 1e-4 and 1e-3 for the
policy and critic network, respectively.

# Natural Policy Gradient

The following approach has been introduced by Kakade (2002).

~~~
Using policy gradient theorem, we are able to compute $∇ v_π$. Normally, we
update the parameters by using directly this gradient. This choice is justified
by the fact that a vector $→d$ which maximizes $v_π(s; →θ + →d)$ under
the constraint that $|→d|^2$ is bounded by a small constant is exactly
the gradient $∇ v_π$.

~~~
Normally, the length $|→d|^2$ is computed using Euclidean metric. But in general,
any metric could be used. Representing a metric using a positive-definite matrix
$⇉G$ (identity matrix for Euclidean metric), we can compute the distance as
$|→d|^2 = ∑_{ij} G_{ij} d_i d_j = →d^T ⇉G →d$. The steepest ascent direction is
then given by $⇉G^{-1} ∇ v_π$.

~~~
Note that when $⇉G$ is the Hessian $⇉H v_π$, the above process is exactly
Newton's method.

# Natural Policy Gradient

A suitable choice for the metric is _Fisher information matrix_ defined as
$$F_s(→θ) ≝ 𝔼_{π(a | s; →θ)} \left[\frac{∂ \log π(a | s; →θ)}{∂ →θ_i} \frac{∂ \log π(a | s; →θ)}{∂ →θ_j} \right]
\color{gray} = 𝔼[∇ π(a | s; →θ)] 𝔼[∇ π(a | s; →θ)]^T.$$

~~~
It can be shown that the Fisher information metric is the only Riemannian metric
(up to rescaling) invariant to change of parameters under sufficient statistic.

~~~
Recall Kullback-Leibler distance (or relative entropy) defined as
$$D_\textrm{KL}(→p || →q) ≝ ∑_i p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \color{gray} = H(p, q) - H(p).$$

~~~
The Fisher information matrix is also a Hessian of the
$D_\textrm{KL}(π(a | s; →θ) || π(a | s; →θ')$:
$$F_s(→θ) = \frac{∂^2}{∂θ_i' ∂θ_j'} D_\textrm{KL}(π(a | s; →θ) || π(a | s; →θ')\Big|_{→θ' = →θ}.$$

# Natural Policy Gradient

Using the metric
$$F(→θ) = 𝔼_{s ∼ μ_→θ} F_s(→θ)$$
we want to update the parameters using $→d_F ≝ F(→θ)^{-1} ∇ v_π$.

~~~
An interesting property of using the $→d_F$ to update the parameters is that
- updating $→θ$ using $∇ v_π$ will choose an arbitrary _better_ action in state
  $s$;
~~~
- updating $→θ$ using $F(→θ)^{-1} ∇ v_π$ chooses the _best_ action (maximizing
  expected return), similarly to tabular greedy policy improvement.

~~~
However, computing $→d_F$ in a straightforward way is too costly.

---
# Truncated Natural Policy Gradient

Duan et al. (2016) in paper _Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for
Continuous Control_ propose a modification to the NPG to efficiently compute
$→d_F$.

~~~
Following Schulman et al. (2015), they suggest to use _conjugate gradient
algorithm_, which can solve a system of linear equations $⇉A→x = →b$
in an iterative manner, by using $⇉A$ only to compute products $⇉A→v$ for
a suitable $→v$.

~~~
Therefore, $→d_F$ is found as a solution of
$$F(→θ)→d_F = ∇ v_π$$
and using only 10 iterations of the algorithm seem to suffice according to the
experiments.

~~~
Furthermore, Duan et al. suggest to use a specific learning rate suggested by
Peters et al (2008) of
$$\frac{α}{\sqrt{(∇ v_π)^T F(→θ)^{-1} ∇ v_π}}.$$

section: TRPO
# Trust Region Policy Optimization

Schulman et al. in 2015 wrote an influential paper introducing TRPO as an
improved variant of NPG.

~~~
Considering two policies $π, π̃$, we can write
$$v_π̃ = v_π + 𝔼_{s ∼ μ(π̃)} 𝔼_{a ∼ π̃(a | s)} a_π(a | s),$$
where $a_π(a | s)$ is the advantage function $q_π(a | s) - v_π(s)$ and
$μ(π̃)$ is the on-policy distribution of the policy $π̃$.

~~~
Analogously to policy improvement, we see that if $a_π(a | s) ≥0$, policy
$π̃$ performance increases (or stays the same if the advantages are zero
everywhere).

~~~
However, sampling states $s ∼ μ(π̃)$ is costly. Therefore, we instead
consider
$$L_π(π̃) = v_π + 𝔼_{s ∼ μ(π)} 𝔼_{a ∼ π̃(a | s)} a_π(a | s).$$

---
# Trust Region Policy Optimization
$$L_π(π̃) = v_π + 𝔼_{s ∼ μ(π)} 𝔼_{a ∼ π̃(a | s)} a_π(a | s)$$

It can be shown that for parametrized $π(a | s; →θ)$ the $L_π(π̃)$ matches
$v_{π̃}$ to the first order.

~~~
Schulman et al. additionally proves that if we denote
$α = D_\textrm{KL}^\textrm{max}(π_\textrm{old} || π_\textrm{new})
   = \max_s D_\textrm{KL}\big(π_\textrm{old}(⋅|s) || π_\textrm{new}(⋅|s)\big)$, then
$$v_{π_\textrm{new}} ≥ L_{π_\textrm{old}}(π_\textrm{new}) - \frac{4εγ}{(1-γ)^2}α\textrm{~~~where~~~}ε = \max_{s, a} |a_π(s, a)|.$$

~~~
Therefore, TRPO minimizes $L_{π_{→θ_0}}(π_→θ)$ subject to
$D_\textrm{KL}^{→θ_0}(π_{→θ_0} || π_→θ) < δ$, where
- $D_\textrm{KL}^{→θ_0}(π_{→θ_0} || π_→θ) = 𝔼_{s ∼ μ(π_{→θ_0})} [D_\textrm{KL}\big(π_\textrm{old}(⋅|s) || π_\textrm{new}(⋅|s)\big)]$
  is used instead of $D_\textrm{KL}^\textrm{max}$ for performance reasons;
~~~
- $δ$ is a constant found empirically, as the one implied by the above equation
  is too small;
~~~
- importance sampling is used to account for sampling actions from $π$.

# Trust Region Policy Optimization

$$\textrm{minimize}~~L_{π_{→θ_0}}(π_→θ)~~\textrm{subject to}~~D_\textrm{KL}^{→θ_0}(π_{→θ_0} || π_→θ) < δ$$

The parameters are updated using $→d_F = F(→θ)^{-1} ∇ L_{π_{→θ_0}}(π_→θ)$, utilizing the
conjugate gradient algorithm as described earlier for TNPG (note that the
algorithm was designed originally for TRPO and only later employed for TNPG).

~~~
To guarantee improvement and respect the $D_\textrm{KL}$ constraint, a line
search is in fact performed. We start by the learning rate of
$\sqrt{δ/(→d_F^T F(→θ)^{-1} →d_F)}$ and shrink it exponentially until
the constraint is satistifed and the objective improves.

# Proximal Policy Optimization

A simplification of TRPO which can be implemented using a few lines of code.

Let $r_t(→θ) ≝ \frac{π(A_t|S_t; →θ)}{π(A_t|S_t; →θ_\textrm{old})}$. PPO
minimizes the objective
$$L^\textrm{CLIP}(→θ) ≝ 𝔼_t\Big[\min\big(r_t(→θ) Â_t, \operatorname{clip}(r_t(→θ), 1-ε, 1+ε) Â_t)\big)\Big].$$

Such $L^\textrm{CLIP}(→θ)$ is a lower (pessimistic) bound.

$$Â_t ≝ ∑_{i=0}^{T-t-1} (γλ)^i δ_{t+i},$$
where $δ_t = R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)$.
