# Parallel Advantage Actor Critic

An alternative to independent workers is to train in a synchronous and
centralized way by having the workes to only generate episodes. Such approach
was described in May 2017 by Clemente et al., who named their agent
_parallel advantage actor-critic_ (PAAC).

The authors use $8$ workers, $n_e=32$ parallel environments, $5$-step returns,
$γ=0.99$, $ε=0.1$, $β=0.01$ and a learning rate of $α=0.0007⋅n_e=0.0224$.

The $\textrm{arch}_\textrm{nips}$ is from A3C: 16 filters $8×8$ stride 4, 32
filters $4×4$ stride 2, a dense layer with 256 units. The
$\textrm{arch}_\textrm{nature}$ is from DQN: 32 filters $8×8$ stride 4, 64
filters $4×4$ stride 2, 64 filters $3×3$ stride 1 and 512-unit fully connected
layer. All nonlinearities are ReLU.

section: Continuous Action Space
# Continuous Action Space

Until now, the actions were discrete. However, many environments naturally
accept actions from continuous space. We now consider actions which come
from range $[a, b]$ for $a, b ∈ ℝ$, or more generally from a Cartesian product
of several such ranges:
$$∏_i [a_i, b_i].$$

~~~

A simple way how to parametrize the action distribution is to choose them from
the normal distribution.

Given mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$, probability density function of $𝓝(μ, σ^2)$
is
$$p(x) ≝ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 π σ^2}} e^{\large-\frac{(x - μ)^2}{2σ^2}}.$$

# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

Utilizing continuous action spaces in gradient-based methods is straightforward.
Instead of the $\softmax$ distribution we suitably parametrize the action value,
usually using the normal distribution. Considering only one real-valued action,
we therefore have
$$π(a | s; →θ) ≝ P\Big(a ∼ 𝓝\big(μ(s; →θ), σ(s; →θ)^2\big)\Big),$$
where $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ are function approximation of mean and standard
deviation of the action distribution.

The mean and standard deviation are usually computed from the shared
representation, with
- the mean being computed as a regular regression (i.e., one output neuron
  without activation);
- the standard deviation (which must be positive) being computed again as
  a single neuron, but with either $\exp$ or $\operatorname{softplus}$, where
  $\operatorname{softplus}(x) ≝ \log(1 + e^x)$.

# Continuous Action Space in Gradient Methods

During training, we compute $μ(s; →θ)$ and $σ(s; →θ)$ and then sample the action
value (clipping it to $[a, b]$ if required). To compute the loss, we utilize
the probability density function of the normal distribution (and usually also
add the entropy penalty).

~~~
```python
  mus = tf.keras.layers.Dense(actions)(hidden_layer)
  sds = tf.keras.layers.Dense(actions)(hidden_layer)
  sds = tf.math.exp(sds)   # or sds = tf.math.softplus(sds)

  action_dist = tfp.distributions.Normal(mus, sds)

  # Loss computed as - log π(a|s) * returns - entropy_regularization
  loss = - action_dist.log_prob(actions) * returns \
         - args.entropy_regularization * action_dist.entropy()
```

---
# Continuous Action Space

When the action consists of several real values, i.e., action is a suitable
subregion of $ℝ^n$ for $n>1$, we can:
- either use multivariate Gaussian distribution;
- or factorize the probability into a product of univariate normal
  distributions.

~~~
Modeling the action distribution using a single normal distribution might be
insufficient, in which case a mixture of normal distributions is usually used.

~~~
Sometimes, the continuous action space is used even for discrete output -- when
modeling pixels intensities (256 values) or sound amplitude (2$^{16}$ values),
instead of a softmax we use discretized mixture of distributions,
usually $\operatorname{logistic}$ (a distribution with a sigmoid cdf). Then,
$$π(a) = ∑_i p_i\Big(σ\big((a + 0.5 - μ_i) / σ_i\big) - σ\big((a - 0.5 - μ_i) / σ_i\big) \Big).$$
However, such mixtures are usually used in generative modeling, not in
reinforcement learning.

# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem

Combining continuous actions and Deep Q Networks is not straightforward.
In order to do so, we need a different variant of the policy gradient theorem.

~~~
Recall that in policy gradient theorem,
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} q_π(s, a) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ).$$

~~~
## Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem
Assume that the policy $π(s; →θ)$ is deterministic and computes
an action $a∈ℝ$. Further, assume the reward $r(s, a)$ is actually
a deterministic function of the given state-action pair.
Then, under several assumptions about continuousness, the following holds:
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ 𝔼_{s ∼ μ} \Big[∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s;→θ)}\Big].$$

The theorem was first proven in the paper Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms
by David Silver et al in 2014.

---
# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem – Proof

The proof is very similar to the original (stochastic) policy gradient theorem.

~~~
However, we will be exchanging derivatives and integrals, for which we need
several assumptions:
~~~
- we assume that $h(s), p(s' | s, a), ∇_a p(s' | s, a), r(s, a), ∇_a r(s, a),
  π(s; →θ), ∇_→θ π(s; →θ)$ are continuous in all parameters and variables;
~~~
- we further assume that $h(s), p(s' | s, a), ∇_a p(s' | s, a), r(s, a), ∇_a
  r(s, a)$ are bounded.

Details about which assumptions are required when can be found in Appendix B
of _Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms: Supplementary Material_ by
David Silver et al.

# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem – Proof

$\displaystyle ∇_→θ v_π(s) = ∇_→θ q_π(s, π(s; →θ))$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ\Big(r\big(s, π(s; →θ)\big) + ∫_{s'} p\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) γv_π(s') \d s'\Big)$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a r(s, a) \big|_{a=π(s; →θ)} + ∇_→θ ∫_{s'} γp\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) v_π(s') \d s'$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a \Big(r(s, a) + ∫_{s'} γp\big(s' | s, a\big) v_π(s') \d s' \Big) \Big|_{a=π(s; →θ)}\\
                    \qquad\qquad\qquad + ∫_{s'} γp\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) ∇_→θ v_π(s') \d s'$

~~~
$\displaystyle \phantom{∇_→θ v_π(s)} = ∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s; →θ)} + ∫_{s'} γp\big(s' | s, π(s; →θ)\big) ∇_→θ v_π(s') \d s'$

~~~
We finish the proof as in the gradient theorem by continually expanding $∇_→θ v_π(s')$, getting
$∇_→θ v_π(s) = ∫_{s'} ∑_{k=0}^∞ γ^k P(s → s'\textrm{~in~}k\textrm{~steps~}|π) \big[∇_→θ π(s'; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s', a)\big|_{a=π(s';→θ)}\big] \d s'$
~~~
and then $∇_→θ J(→θ) = 𝔼_{s ∼ h} ∇_→θ v_π(s) ∝ 𝔼_{s ∼ μ} \big[∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s;→θ)}\big]$.

# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

Note that the formulation of deterministic policy gradient theorem allows an
off-policy algorithm, because the loss functions no longer depends on actions
(similarly to how expected Sarsa is also an off-policy algorithm).

~~~
We therefore train function approximation for both $π(s; →θ)$ and $q(s, a; →θ)$,
training $q(s, a; →θ)$ using a deterministic variant of the Bellman equation:
$$q(S_t, A_t; →θ) = 𝔼_{R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}} \big[R_{t+1} + γ q(S_{t+1}, π(S_{t+1}; →θ))\big]$$
and $π(s; →θ)$ according to the deterministic policy gradient theorem.

~~~
The algorithm was first described in the paper Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning
by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al. (2015).

The authors utilize a replay buffer, a target network (updated by exponential
moving average with $τ=0.001$), batch normalization for CNNs, and perform
exploration by adding a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise to predicted actions.
Training is performed by Adam with learning rates of 1e-4 and 1e-3 for the
policy and critic network, respectively.

# Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Exploration

While the exploration policy could just use Gaussian noise, the authors claim
that temporarily-correlated noise is more effective for physical control
problems with inertia.

~~~
They therefore generate noise using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, by computing
$$n_t ← n_{t-1} + θ ⋅ (μ - n_{t-1}) + ε∼𝓝(0, σ^2),$$
utilizing hyperparameter values $τ=0.15$ and $σ=0.2$.
