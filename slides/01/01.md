# History of Reinforcement Learning

Note that the machines learn just to obtain a reward we have defined,
they do not learn what we want them to.

# Multi-armed Bandits

We start by selecting action $A_1$, which is the index of the arm to use, and we
get a reward of $R_1$. We then repeat the process by selecting actions $A_2$, $A_3$, ‚Ä¶

~~~
Let $q_*(a)$ be the real **value** of an action $a$:
$$q_*(a) = ùîº[R_t | A_t = a].$$

~~~

Denoting $Q_t(a)$ our estimated value of action $a$ at time $t$ (before taking
trial $t$), we would like $Q_t(a)$ to converge to $q_*(a)$. A natural way to
estimate $Q_t(a)$ is
$$Q_t(a) ‚âù \frac{\textrm{sum of rewards when action }a\textrm{ is taken}}{\textrm{number of times action }a\textrm{ was taken}}.$$

~~~
Following the definition of $Q_t(a)$, we could choose a **greedy** action $A_t$ as
$$A_t ‚âù \argmax_a Q_t(a).$$

---
section: $Œµ$-greedy
# $Œµ$-greedy Method

## Exploitation versus Exploration

Choosing a greedy action is **exploitation** of current estimates. We however also
need to **explore** the space of actions to improve our estimates.

~~~

An _$Œµ$-greedy_ method follows the greedy action with probability $1-Œµ$, and
chooses a uniformly random action with probability $Œµ$.

# $Œµ$-greedy Method

## Incremental Implementation

Let $Q_{n+1}$ be an estimate using $n$ rewards $R_1, \ldots, R_n$.

$$\begin{aligned}
Q_{n+1} &= \frac{1}{n} ‚àë_{i=1}^n R_i \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + \frac{n-1}{n-1} ‚àë_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + (n-1) Q_n) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + n Q_n - Q_n) \\
    &= Q_n + \frac{1}{n}\Big(R_n - Q_n\Big)
\end{aligned}$$

# $Œµ$-greedy Method Algorithm

![w=100%,v=middle](bandits_algorithm.svgz)

# Fixed Learning Rate

Analogously to the solution obtained for a stationary problem, we consider
$$Q_{n+1} = Q_n + Œ±(R_n - Q_n).$$

~~~
Converges to the true action values if
$$‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû Œ±_n = ‚àû \textrm{~~~~and~~~~}‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû Œ±_n^2 < ‚àû.$$

~~~
Biased method, because
$$Q_{n+1} = (1 - Œ±)^n Q_1 + ‚àë_{i=1}^n Œ±(1-Œ±)^{n-i} R_i.$$

~~~
The bias can be utilized to support exploration at the start of the episode by
setting the initial values to more than the expected value of the optimal
solution.

# Markov Decision Process

![w=55%,h=center](diagram.svgz)

A **Markov decision process** (MDP) is a quadruple $(ùì¢, ùìê, p, Œ≥)$,
where:
- $ùì¢$ is a set of states,
~~~
- $ùìê$ is a set of actions,
~~~
- $p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$ is a probability that
  action $a ‚àà ùìê$ will lead from state $s ‚àà ùì¢$ to $s' ‚àà ùì¢$, producing a **reward** $r ‚àà ‚Ñù$,
~~~
- $Œ≥ ‚àà [0, 1]$ is a **discount factor**.

~~~
Let a **return** $G_t$ be $G_t ‚âù ‚àë_{k=0}^‚àû Œ≥^k R_{t + 1 + k}$. The goal is to optimize $ùîº[G_0]$.

---
# Multi-armed Bandits as MDP

To formulate $n$-armed bandits problem as MDP, we do not need states.
Therefore, we could formulate it as:
- one-element set of states, $ùì¢=\{S\}$;
~~~
- an action for every arm, $ùìê=\{a_1, a_2, ‚Ä¶, a_n\}$;
~~~
- assuming every arm produces rewards with a distribution of $ùìù(Œº_i, œÉ_i^2)$,
  the MDP dynamics function $p$ is defined as
  $$p(S, r | S, a_i) = ùìù(r | Œº_i, œÉ_i^2).$$

~~~
One possibility to introduce states in multi-armed bandits problem is to
consider a separate reward distribution for every state. Such generalization is
called **Contextualized Bandits** problem. Assuming state transitions are
independent on rewards and given by a distribution $\textit{next}(s)$, the MDP
dynamics function for contextualized bandits problem is given by
$$p(s', r | s, a_i) = ùìù(r | Œº_{i,s}, œÉ_{i,s}^2) ‚ãÖ \textit{next}(s'|s).$$

---
section: Monte Carlo Methods
# Monte Carlo Methods

We now present the first algorithm for computing optimal policies without assuming
a knowledge of the environment dynamics.

However, we still assume there are finitely many states $ùì¢$ and we will store
estimates for each of them.

~~~
Monte Carlo methods are based on estimating returns from complete episodes.
Specifically, they try to estimate
$$Q(s, a) ‚âà ùîº[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a].$$

~~~
With such estimates, a greedy action in state $S_t$ can be computed as
$$A_t = \argmax_a Q(S_t, a).$$

~~~
To guarantee convergence, we need to visit each state-action pair infinitely many times.
One of the simplest way to achieve that is to assume **exploring starts**, where
we randomly select the first state and first action, and behave greedily
afterwards.

# Monte Carlo with Exploring Starts

![w=90%,h=center](monte_carlo_exploring_starts.svgz)


---
# Monte Carlo and $Œµ$-soft Policies

The problem with exploring starts is that in many situations, we either cannot
start in an arbitrary state, or it is impractical.

~~~
A policy is called $Œµ$-soft, if
$$œÄ(a|s) ‚â• \frac{Œµ}{|ùìê(s)|}.$$
and we call it $Œµ$-greedy, if one action has a maximum probability of
$1-Œµ+\frac{Œµ}{|A(s)|}$.

~~~
For $Œµ$-soft policy, Monte Carlo policy evaluation also converges, without the need
of exploring starts.

---
# Monte Carlo for $Œµ$-soft Policies

### On-policy every-visit Monte Carlo for $Œµ$-soft Policies
Algorithm parameter: small $Œµ>0$

Initialize $Q(s, a) ‚àà ‚Ñù$ arbitrarily (usually to 0), for all $s ‚àà ùì¢, a ‚àà ùìê$<br>
Initialize $C(s, a) ‚àà ‚Ñ§$ to 0, for all $s ‚àà ùì¢, a ‚àà ùìê$

Repeat forever (for each episode):
- Generate an episode $S_0, A_0, R_1, ‚Ä¶, S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_T$,
  by generating actions as follows:
  - With probability $Œµ$, generate a random uniform action
  - Otherwise, set $A_t ‚âù \argmax\nolimits_a Q(S_t, a)$
- $G ‚Üê 0$
- For each $t=T-1, T-2, ‚Ä¶, 0$:
  - $G ‚Üê Œ≥G + R_{t+1}$
  - $C(S_t, A_t) ‚Üê C(S_t, A_t) + 1$
  - $Q(S_t, A_t) ‚Üê Q(S_t, A_t) + \frac{1}{C(S_t, A_t)}(G - Q(S_t, A_t))$

section: POMDP
# Partially Observable MDPs

Recall that the Markov decision process is a quadruple $(ùì¢, ùìê, p, Œ≥)$,
where:
- $ùì¢$ is a set of states,
- $ùìê$ is a set of actions,
- $p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$ is a probability that
  action $a ‚àà ùìê$ will lead from state $s ‚àà ùì¢$ to $s' ‚àà ùì¢$, producing a reward $r ‚àà ‚Ñù$,
- $Œ≥ ‚àà [0, 1]$ is a discount factor.

~~~
**Partially observable Markov decision process** extends the Markov decision
process to a sextuple $(ùì¢, ùìê, p, Œ≥, ùìû, o)$, where in addition to an MDP
- $ùìû$ is a set of observations,
- $o(O_t | S_t, A_{t-1})$ is an observation model, which is used as agent input
  instead of $S_t$.

~~~
Although planning in general POMDP is undecidable, several approaches are used to
handle POMDPs in robotics (to model uncertainty, imprecise mechanisms and inaccurate
sensors, ‚Ä¶). In deep RL, partially observable MDPs are usually handled using recurrent
networks, which model the latent states $S_t$.
