# History of Reinforcement Learning

Note that the machines learn just to obtain a reward we have defined,
they do not learn what we want them to.

# Multi-armed Bandits

We start by selecting action $A_1$, which is the index of the arm to use, and we
get a reward of $R_1$. We then repeat the process by selecting actions $A_2$, $A_3$, …

~~~
Let $q_*(a)$ be the real **value** of an action $a$:
$$q_*(a) = 𝔼[R_t | A_t = a].$$

~~~

Denoting $Q_t(a)$ our estimated value of action $a$ at time $t$ (before taking
trial $t$), we would like $Q_t(a)$ to converge to $q_*(a)$. A natural way to
estimate $Q_t(a)$ is
$$Q_t(a) ≝ \frac{\textrm{sum of rewards when action }a\textrm{ is taken}}{\textrm{number of times action }a\textrm{ was taken}}.$$

~~~
Following the definition of $Q_t(a)$, we could choose a **greedy** action $A_t$ as
$$A_t ≝ \argmax_a Q_t(a).$$

---
section: $ε$-greedy
# $ε$-greedy Method

## Exploitation versus Exploration

Choosing a greedy action is **exploitation** of current estimates. We however also
need to **explore** the space of actions to improve our estimates.

~~~

An _$ε$-greedy_ method follows the greedy action with probability $1-ε$, and
chooses a uniformly random action with probability $ε$.

# $ε$-greedy Method

## Incremental Implementation

Let $Q_{n+1}$ be an estimate using $n$ rewards $R_1, \ldots, R_n$.

$$\begin{aligned}
Q_{n+1} &= \frac{1}{n} ∑_{i=1}^n R_i \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + \frac{n-1}{n-1} ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + (n-1) Q_n) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + n Q_n - Q_n) \\
    &= Q_n + \frac{1}{n}\Big(R_n - Q_n\Big)
\end{aligned}$$

# $ε$-greedy Method Algorithm

---
# Fixed Learning Rate

Analogously to the solution obtained for a stationary problem, we consider
$$Q_{n+1} = Q_n + α(R_n - Q_n).$$

~~~
Converges to the true action values if
$$∑_{n=1}^∞ α_n = ∞ \textrm{~~~~and~~~~}∑_{n=1}^∞ α_n^2 < ∞.$$

~~~
Biased method, because
$$Q_{n+1} = (1 - α)^n Q_1 + ∑_{i=1}^n α(1-α)^{n-i} R_i.$$

~~~
The bias can be utilized to support exploration at the start of the episode by
setting the initial values to more than the expected value of the optimal
solution.

section: MDP
# Markov Decision Process

# Markov Decision Process

![w=55%,h=center](diagram.svgz)

A **Markov decision process** (MDP) is a quadruple $(𝓢, 𝓐, p, γ)$,
where:
- $𝓢$ is a set of states,
~~~
- $𝓐$ is a set of actions,
~~~
- $p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$ is a probability that
  action $a ∈ 𝓐$ will lead from state $s ∈ 𝓢$ to $s' ∈ 𝓢$, producing a **reward** $r ∈ ℝ$,
~~~
- $γ ∈ [0, 1]$ is a **discount factor**.

~~~
Let a **return** $G_t$ be $G_t ≝ ∑_{k=0}^∞ γ^k R_{t + 1 + k}$. The goal is to optimize $𝔼[G_0]$.

---
# Multi-armed Bandits as MDP

To formulate $n$-armed bandits problem as MDP, we do not need states.
Therefore, we could formulate it as:
- one-element set of states, $𝓢=\{S\}$;
~~~
- an action for every arm, $𝓐=\{a_1, a_2, …, a_n\}$;
~~~
- assuming every arm produces rewards with a distribution of $𝓝(μ_i, σ_i^2)$,
  the MDP dynamics function $p$ is defined as
  $$p(S, r | S, a_i) = 𝓝(r | μ_i, σ_i^2).$$

~~~
One possibility to introduce states in multi-armed bandits problem is to
consider a separate reward distribution for every state. Such generalization is
called **Contextualized Bandits** problem. Assuming state transitions are
independent on rewards and given by a distribution $\textit{next}(s)$, the MDP
dynamics function for contextualized bandits problem is given by
$$p(s', r | s, a_i) = 𝓝(r | μ_{i,s}, σ_{i,s}^2) ⋅ \textit{next}(s'|s).$$

section: Monte Carlo Methods
# Monte Carlo Methods

We now present the first algorithm for computing optimal policies without assuming
a knowledge of the environment dynamics.

However, we still assume there are finitely many states $𝓢$ and we will store
estimates for each of them.

~~~
Monte Carlo methods are based on estimating returns from complete episodes.
Furthermore, if the model (of the environment) is not known, we need to
estimate returns for the action-value function $q$ instead of $v$.

~~~
To guarantee convergence, we need to visit each state infinitely many times.
One of the simplest way to achieve that is to assume **exploring starts**, where
we randomly select the first state and first action, each pair with nonzero
probability.

# Monte Carlo with Exploring Starts

![w=90%,h=center](monte_carlo_exploring_starts.svgz)


---
# Monte Carlo and $ε$-soft Policies

The problem with exploring starts is that in many situations, we either cannot
start in an arbitrary state, or it is impractical.

~~~
A policy is called $ε$-soft, if
$$π(a|s) ≥ \frac{ε}{|𝓐(s)|}.$$
and we call it $ε$-greedy, if one action has a maximum probability of
$1-ε+\frac{ε}{|A(s)|}$.

~~~
For $ε$-soft policy, Monte Carlo policy evaluation also converges, without the need
of exploring starts.

---
# Monte Carlo for $ε$-soft Policies

### On-policy every-visit Monte Carlo for $ε$-soft Policies
Algorithm parameter: small $ε>0$

Initialize $Q(s, a) ∈ ℝ$ arbitrarily (usually to 0), for all $s ∈ 𝓢, a ∈ 𝓐$<br>
Initialize $C(s, a) ∈ ℤ$ to 0, for all $s ∈ 𝓢, a ∈ 𝓐$

Repeat forever (for each episode):
- Generate an episode $S_0, A_0, R_1, …, S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_T$,
  by generating actions as follows:
  - With probability $ε$, generate a random uniform action
  - Otherwise, set $A_t ≝ \argmax\nolimits_a Q(S_t, a)$
- $G ← 0$
- For each $t=T-1, T-2, …, 0$:
  - $G ← γG + R_{t+1}$
  - $C(S_t, A_t) ← C(S_t, A_t) + 1$
  - $Q(S_t, A_t) ← Q(S_t, A_t) + \frac{1}{C(S_t, A_t)}(G - Q(S_t, A_t))$
