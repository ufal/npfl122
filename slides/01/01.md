# Multi-armed Bandits

We start by selecting action $A_1$, which is the index of the arm to use, and we
get a reward of $R_1$. We then repeat the process by selecting actions $A_2$, $A_3$, …

~~~
Let $q_*(a)$ be the real _value_ of an action $a$:
$$q_*(a) = 𝔼[R_t | A_t = a].$$

~~~

Denoting $Q_t(a)$ our estimated value of action $a$ at time $t$ (before taking
trial $t$), we would like $Q_t(a)$ to converge to $q_*(a)$. A natural way to
estimate $Q_t(a)$ is
$$Q_t(a) ≝ \frac{\textrm{sum of rewards when action }a\textrm{ is taken}}{\textrm{number of times action }a\textrm{ was taken}}.$$

~~~
Following the definition of $Q_t(a)$, we could choose a _greedy action_ $A_t$ as
$$A_t(a) ≝ \argmax_a Q_t(a).$$

section: $ε$-greedy
# $ε$-greedy Method

## Exploitation versus Exploration

Choosing a greedy action is _exploitation_ of current estimates. We however also
need to _explore_ the space of actions to improve our estimates.

~~~

An _$ε$-greedy_ method follows the greedy action with probability $1-ε$, and
chooses a uniformly random action with probability $ε$.

# $ε$-greedy Method

## Incremental Implementation

Let $Q_{n+1}$ be an estimate using $n$ rewards $R_1, \ldots, R_n$.

$$\begin{aligned}
Q_{n+1} &= \frac{1}{n} ∑_{i=1}^n R_i \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + \frac{n-1}{n-1} ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + (n-1) Q_n) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} (R_n + n Q_n - Q_n) \\
    &= Q_n + \frac{1}{n}\Big(R_n - Q_n\Big)
\end{aligned}$$

section: Non-stationary Problems
# Fixed Learning Rate

Analogously to the solution obtained for a stationary problem, we consider
$$Q_{n+1} = Q_n + α(R_n - Q_n).$$

~~~
Converges to the true action values if
$$∑_{n=1}^∞ α_n = ∞ \textrm{~~~~and~~~~}∑_{n=1}^∞ α_n^2 < ∞.$$

~~~
Biased method, because
$$Q_{n+1} = (1 - α)^n Q_1 + ∑_{i=1}^n α(1-α)^{n-i} R_i.$$

~~~
The bias can be utilized to support exploration at the start of the episode by
setting the initial values to more than the expected value of the optimal
solution.

section: UCB
# Upper Confidence Bound

Using same epsilon for all actions in $ε$-greedy method seems inefficient. One
possible improvement is to select action according to upper confidence bound
(instead of choosing a random action with probability $ε$):
$$A_t ≝ \argmax_a \left[Q_t(a) + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{N_t(a)}}\right].$$

The updates are then performed as before (e.g., using averaging, or fixed
learning rate $α$).

---
# Motivation Behind Upper Confidence Bound

Actions with little average reward are probably selected too often.

~~~
Instead of simple $ε$-greedy approach, we might try selecting an action as
little as possible, but still enough to converge.

~~~
Assuming random variables $X_i$ bounded by $[0, 1]$ and $X̄ = ∑_{i=1}^N
X_i$, (Chernoff-)Hoeffding's inequality states that
$$P(X̄ - 𝔼[X̄] ≥ δ) ≤ e^{-2nδ^2}.$$

~~~
Our goal is to choose $δ$ such that for every action,
$$P(Q_t(a) - q_*(a) ≥ δ) ≤ \left(\frac{1}{t}\right)^α.$$

~~~
We can achieve the required inequality (with $α=2$) by setting
$$δ ≥ \sqrt{(\ln t)/N_t(a)}.$$

---
# Asymptotical Optimality of UCB

We define _regret_ as a difference of maximum of what we could get
(i.e., repeatedly using action with maximum expectation) and
what a strategy yields, i.e.,
$$\textit{regret}_N ≝ N \max_a q_*(a) - ∑_{i=1}^N 𝔼[R_i].$$

~~~
It can be shown that regret of UCB is asymptotically optimal,
see Lai and Robbins (1985), Asymptotically Efficient Adaptive Allocation Rules.

section: Gradient
# Gradient Bandit Algorithms

Let $H_t(a)$ be a numerical _preference_ for an action $a$ at time $t$.

~~~
We could choose actions according to softmax distribution:
$$π(A_t = a) ≝ \softmax(a) = \frac{e^{H_t(a)}}{∑_b e^{H_t(b)}}.$$

~~~
Usually, all $H_1(a)$ are set to zero, which corresponds to random uniform
initial policy.

~~~
Using SGD and MLE loss, we can derive the following algorithm:
$$H_{t+1}(a) ← H_t(a) + αR_t([a = A_t] - π(a)).$$
