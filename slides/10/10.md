# Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem

Combining continuous actions and Deep Q Networks is not straightforward.
In order to do so, we need a different variant of the policy gradient theorem.

Recall that in policy gradient theorem,
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ ∑_{s∈𝓢} μ(s) ∑_{a ∈ 𝓐} q_π(s, a) ∇_→θ π(a | s; →θ).$$

## Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem
Assume that the policy $π(s; →θ)$ is deterministic and computes
an action $a∈ℝ$. Then under several assumptions about continuousness, the
following holds:
$$∇_→θ J(→θ) ∝ 𝔼_{s∼μ(s)} \Big[∇_→θ π(s; →θ) ∇_a q_π(s, a)\big|_{a=π(s;→θ)}\Big].$$

The theorem was first proven in the paper Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms
by David Silver et al.

# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

Note that the formulation of deterministic policy gradient theorem allows an
off-policy algorithm, because the loss functions no longer depends on actions
(similarly to how expected Sarsa is also an off-policy algorithm).

We therefore train function approximation for both $π(s; →θ)$ and $q(s, a; →θ)$,
training $q(s, a; →θ)$ using a deterministic variant of the Bellman equation:
$$q(S_t, A_t; →θ) = 𝔼_{R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}} \big[R_{t+1} + γ q(S_{t+1}, π(S_{t+1}; →θ))\big]$$
and $π(s; →θ)$ according to the deterministic policy gradient theorem.

The algorithm was first described in the paper Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning
by Timothy P. Lillicrap et al. (2015).

The authors utilize a replay buffer, a target network (updated by exponential
moving average with $τ=0.001$), batch normalization for CNNs, and perform
exploration by adding a normal-distributed noise to predicted actions.
Training is performed by Adam with learning rates of 1e-4 and 1e-3 for the
policy and critic network, respectively.

# Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

The paper Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods by
Scott Fujimoto et al. from February 2018 proposes improvements to DDPG which

- decrease maximization bias by training two critics and choosing minimum of
  their predictions;

- introduce several variance-lowering optimizations:
  - delayed policy updates;
  - target policy smoothing.

# TD3 – Maximization Bias

Similarly to Q-learning, the DDPG algorithm suffers from maximization bias.
In Q-learning, the maximization bias was caused by the explicit $\max$ operator.
For DDPG methods, it can be caused by the gradient descent itself. Let
$→θ_\textit{approx}$ be the parameters maximizing the $q_→θ$ and let
$→θ_\textit{true}$ be the hypothetical parameters which maximise true $q_π$,
and let $π_\textit{approx}$ and $π_\textit{true}$ denote the corresponding
policies.

~~~
Because the gradient direction is a local minimizer, for sufficiently small
$α<ε_1$ we have
$$𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{approx})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{true})\big].$$

~~~
However, for real $q_π$ and for sufficiently small $α<ε_2$ it holds that
$$𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{true})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{approx})\big].$$

~~~
Therefore, if $𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{true})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{true})\big]$,
for $α < \min(ε_1, ε_2)$
$$𝔼\big[q_→θ(s, π_\textit{approx})\big] ≥ 𝔼\big[q_π(s, π_\textit{approx})\big].$$

~~~
Analogously to Double DQN we could compute the learning targets using
the current policy and the target critic, i.e., $r + γ q_{→θ'}(s', π_→θ(s'))$
(instead of using target policy and target critic as in DDPG), obtaining DDQN-AC algorithm.
However, the authors found out that the policy changes too slowly and the target
and current networks are too similar.

~~~
Using the original Double Q-learning, two pairs of actors and critics could be
used, with the learning targets computed by the opposite critic, i.e.,
$r + γ q_{→θ'_2}(s', π_{→θ_1}(s))$ for updating $q_{→θ_1}$. The resulting DQ-AC
algorithm is slightly better, but still suffering from oversetimation.

---
# TD3 – Algorithm

The authors instead suggest to employ two critics and one actor. The actor is
trained using one of the critics, and both critics are trained using the same
target computed using the _minimum_ value of both critics as
$$r + γ \min_{i=1,2} q_{→θ'_i}(s', π_{→θ}(s')).$$

~~~
Furthermore, the authors suggest two additional improvements for variance
reduction.
- For obtaining higher quality target values, the authors propose to train the
  critics more often. Therefore, critics are updated each step, but the actor
  and the target networks are updated only every $d$-th step ($d=2$ is used in
  the paper).

~~~
- To explictly model that similar actions should lead to similar results,
  a small random noise is added to performed actions when computing the target
  value:
  $$r + γ \min_{i=1,2} q_{→θ'_i}(s', π_{→θ}(s') + ε)~~~\textrm{for}~~~
    ε ∼ \operatorname{clip}(𝓝(0, σ), -c, c).$$

# AlphaZero

On 7 December 2018, the AlphaZero paper came out in Science journal. It
demonstrates learning chess, shogi and go, _tabula rasa_ – without any
domain-specific human knowledge or data, only using self-play. The evaluation
is performed against strongest programs available.

# AlphaZero – Overview

AlphaZero uses a neural network which using the current state $s$ predicts
$(→p, v) = f(s; →θ)$, where:
- $→p$ is a vector of move probabilities, and
- $v$ is expected outcome of the game as -1, 0, 1.

~~~
Instead of usual alpha-beta search used by classical game playing programs,
AlphaZero uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By a sequence of simulated
self-play games, the search can improve the estimate of $→p$ and $v$, and can be
considered a powerful policy evaluation operator.

~~~
The network is trained from self-play games. The game is played by repeatedly
running MCTS from the state $s_t$ and choosing a move $a_t ∼ →π_t$, until
a terminal position $s_T$ is encountered, which is scored according to game
rules as $z∈\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Finally, the network parameters are trained to
minimize the error between the predicted outcome $v$ and simulated outcome $z$,
and maximize the similarity of the policy vector $→p_t$ and the search
probabilities $→π_t$:
$$L ≝ (z - v)^2 + →π^T \log →p + c||→θ||^2.$$

section: A0-MCTS
# AlphaZero – Monte Carlo Tree Search

MCTS keeps a tree of currently explored states from a fixed root state.
Each node corresponds to a game state. Each state-action pair $(s, a)$
stores the following set of statistics:
- visit count $N(s, a)$,
- total action-value $W(s, a)$,
- mean action value $Q(s, a) ≝ W(s, a) / N(s, a)$,
- prior probability $P(s, a)$ of selecting action $a$ in state $s$.

~~~
Each simulation starts in the root node and finishes in a leaf node $s_L$.
In a state $s_t$, an action is selected using a variant of PUCT algorithm as
$a_t = \argmax\nolimits_a (Q(s_t, a) + U(s_t, a))$, where
$$U(s, a) ≝ C(s) P(s, a) \frac{\sqrt{N(s)}}{1 + N(s, a)}$$
with $C(s) = \log((1+N(s)+c_\textrm{base}) / c_\textrm{base}) + c_\textrm{init}$
being slightly time-increasing exploration rate. Additionally, exploration in
$s_\textrm{root}$ is supported by $P(s_\textrm{root}, a) = (1-ε)p_a + ε\operatorname{Dir}(α)$,
with $ε=0.25$ and $α=0.3, 0.15, 0.03$ for chess, shogi and go, respectively.

# AlphaZero – Monte Carlo Tree Search

When reaching a leaf node, it is evaluated by the network producing $(→p, v)$
and all its children are initialized to $N=W=Q=0$, $P=→p$, and in the backward
pass for all $t ≤ L$ the statistics are updates using $N(s_t, a_t) ← N(s_t, a_t) + 1$
and $W(s_t, a_t) ← W(s_t, a_t) + v$.

~~~

~~~

Finally, the search probabilities in the root are defined as
$→π_\textrm{root} ∝ N(s_\textrm{root}, ⋅)$.

section: A0-Network
# AlphaZero – Network Architecture

The network processes game-specific input, which consists of a history of
8 board positions encoded by several $N × N$ planes, and some number of
constant-valued inputs.

~~~
Output is considered to be a categorical distribution of possible moves. For
chess and shogi, for each piece we consider all possible moves (56 queen
moves, 8 knight moves and 9 underpromotions for chess).

~~~
The input is processed by:
- initial convolution block with CNN with 256 $3×3$ kernels with stride 1, batch
  normalization and ReLU activation,
~~~
- 19 residual blocks, each consisting of two CNN with 256 $3×3$ kernels with stride 1,
  batch normalization and ReLU activation, and a residual connection around
  them,
~~~
- _policy head_, which applies another CNN with batch normalization, followed by
  a convolution with 73/139 filters for chess/shogi, or a linear layer of size
  362 for go,
~~~
- _value head_, which applies another CNN with 1 $1×1$ kernel with stride 1,
  followed by a ReLU layer of size 256 and final $\tanh$ layer of size 1.

section: A0-Training
# AlphaZero – Training

Training is performed by running self-play games of the network with itself.
Each MCTS uses 800 simulations. A replay buffer of one million most recent games
is kept.

~~~
During training, 5000 first-generation TPUs are used to generate self-play games.
Simultaneously, network is trained using SGD with momentum of 0.9 on batches
of size 4096, utilizing 16 second-generation TPUs. Training takes approximately
9 hours for chess, 12 hours for shogi and 13 days for go.

# AlphaZero – Symmetries

In the original AlphaGo Zero, symmetries were explicitly utilized, by
- randomly sampling a symmetry during training,
- randomly sampling a symmetry during evaluation.

However, AlphaZero does not utilize symmetries in any way (because chess and
shogi do not have them).
